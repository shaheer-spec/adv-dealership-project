# Advanced Car Dealership

## Description of the Project

In this program you can sell or lease vehicles to customers, as well as browse, add, and remove cars from the dealership inventory. 
The system automatically calculates prices, taxes, and monthly payments for each sale or lease, then saves the contract details to a file so all transactions are recorded even after the program closes.
## User Stories


- As a user, I want to record a sale or lease for a vehicle from the dealership menu, so that I can easily manage customer transactions in one place.- As a user, I want to see a menu on the screen so that I can choose what actions to take in the dealership application.
- As a user, I want the system to calculate total price and monthly payments automatically, so that I don’t have to manually compute taxes, fees, or financing terms.
- As a user, I want the application to save every completed sale or lease contract to a file, so that there is a permanent record of all dealership transactions.
- As a user, I want the program to remove a sold or leased vehicle from the inventory, so that the dealership’s available vehicle list always stays accurate.
